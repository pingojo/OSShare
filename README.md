OSShare is a GitHub based platform that distributes ownership shares in open-source projects based on the value of individual contributions. It aims to create a fair and transparent system that rewards developers and contributors while preventing potential abuse.

How OSShare works:

- Project Setup: The project owner sets up the open-source project on OSShare, defining the total number of shares, and allocating initial shares to founding members.

- Contribution Tracking: OSShare integrates with Github to track and quantify contributions. Contributions can include code, documentation, design, bug reporting, and more.


- Value Assessment: OSShare uses a combination of automated algorithms and community-driven assessment to determine the value of each contribution. This involves:
  a. Code quality analysis: Automated tools assess code quality, complexity, and test coverage.
  b. Peer review: Contributors review and rate each other's work, providing feedback and a score.
  c. Impact measurement: OSShare tracks the usage, adoption, and performance improvements resulting from contributions.
  d. Non-code contributions: OSShare uses sentiment analysis and community input to evaluate the value of non-code contributions, such as documentation or design work.

- Share Distribution: OSShare calculates the number of shares to be awarded based on the value of each contribution, adjusted for the project's total share pool. Shares are distributed periodically (e.g., monthly) to eligible contributors via cryptocurrency BCH.

- Share Trading: Contributors can trade their shares on a secondary marketplace, enabling them to monetize their contributions, while also allowing external investors to support the project.

Preventing gaming the system:

- Sybil Attack Prevention: OSShare requires users to undergo identity verification (e.g., phone number, social media, or ID verification) to ensure that each user is unique and cannot create multiple accounts to manipulate the system.

- Contribution Validation: To prevent low-quality or spam contributions, a minimum threshold for value assessment is implemented. Contributions must meet a certain quality standard to be eligible for shares.

- Reputation System: OSShare incorporates a reputation system, in which users with a history of high-quality contributions and positive peer reviews gain more influence in the evaluation process. This helps prevent manipulation by malicious actors.

- Governance Model: OSShare employs a decentralized governance model, where decisions about the platform and its policies are made collectively by shareholding contributors. This helps ensure that the system remains fair and transparent, as no single entity has full control.

- Periodic Audits: OSShare conducts periodic audits, both automated and manual, to identify potential abuse and ensure the integrity of the platform. Users found to be gaming the system face penalties, such as reduced shares or temporary/permanent bans.
